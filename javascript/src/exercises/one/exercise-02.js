// ASSIGNMENT: Subscribe to the number$ stream and log each event (next, error, complete) to the console.

//numbersWithErrors$.???

// If you have completed the assignment successfully you should see the an output that is similar to:
//
// next: 1
// next: 9
// next: 4
// next: 7
// error: Error: uh oh! an error!
// 
// This also illustrates that if a stream emits an error event, it will no longer emit a complete event, so a stream
// either terminates with an error event or a complete event.
