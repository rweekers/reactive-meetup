# Reactive Programming workshop 16-12-2016

Welcome to the Reactive Programming workshop!

This workshop is meant to get familiar with RxJS or RxJava (which are both part of the ReactiveX family).
The focus of this workshop lies on familiarizing yourself with the ReactiveX API.
In the presentation prior to the workshop we will explain the Reactive Programming fundamentals and introduce ReactiveX.


## Installation and usage

The repository contains two directories: a `javascript` directory and a `java` directory.
Both directories contain a readme with instruction on installation of the work enviroment, the usage of the exercises and references to external documentation.
Click on one of the links below to directly go to the instructions for either the Java or JavaScript version of the workshop:

* [Java workshop](java/README.md)
* [JavaScript workshop](javascript/README.md)

## Sheets

We have added the sheets for the presentation to the repository as well.
You can download / view the sheets through the link below:

## Demo application

During the workshop we showed a demo application, which illustrates the difference between a 'traditional' and 'reactive' programming style.
This demo application can be found at the following repository:
